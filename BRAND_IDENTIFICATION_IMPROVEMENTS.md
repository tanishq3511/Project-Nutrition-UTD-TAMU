### 2. Improved Food Parsing
- Enhanced `parseAndOfferDiary` function to extract brand information

- Improved food name extraction from user questions and AI responses
- Combined brand and food names for better diary tracking

### 3. Enhanced Meal Context
- Added `brand` and `timestamp` properties to Meal interface

## How It Works

### For Branded Products:
1. User asks: "How many calories in Chobani Greek yogurt?"
2. AI responds with: "Brand: Chobani Greek Yogurt - 80 calories, 15g protein, 6g carbs, 0g fat per 170g serving"
3. System extracts brand name and offers to add to diary
4. Diary entry includes: "Chobani Greek Yogurt" with brand information

### For Generic Foods:
1. User asks: "How many calories in chicken breast?"
2. AI responds with: "Chicken breast: 165 calories, 31g protein, 0g carbs, 3.6g fat per 100g serving"
3. System offers to add to diary without brand information

## Benefits

2. **Improved Tracking**: Users can track specific products they actually consume
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear distinction between branded and generic foods
4. **Better Nutrition Data**: More precise calorie and macro calculations
5. **Comprehensive Database**: Expanded food database with common branded products
