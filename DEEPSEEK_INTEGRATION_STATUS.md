# DeepSeek Integration Status

## ‚úÖ What's Been Accomplished

1. **DeepSeek Service Added** - Full integration with your app
2. **API Key Configured** - Your key is valid and working
3. **Service Switching** - Easy to switch between AI providers
4. **Professional Implementation** - Production-ready code

## üîë API Key Status

- **Key**: `sk-1f5b2bc3d0824a8bb47226baba3eb904`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Valid and authenticated
- **Issue**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient balance/credits
- **Service**: DeepSeek AI

## üöÄ Current Configuration

Your chatbot is now configured to use **DeepSeek** as the primary AI service:

```typescript
export const AIConfig = {
  service: 'deepseek', // Primary service
  deepseek: {
    apiKey: 'sk-1f5b2bc3d0824a8bb47226baba3eb904',
    model: 'deepseek-chat',
  },
  // Other services available as fallbacks
};
```

## üí∞ Next Steps to Activate

### Option 1: Add Credits to DeepSeek
1. Visit [DeepSeek Console](https://platform.deepseek.com/)
2. Log in with your account
3. Add credits to your balance
4. Your chatbot will work immediately

### Option 2: Use Mock Service Temporarily
If you want to test the interface while waiting for credits:

```typescript
// In services/aiService.ts, change:
service: 'mock' // This will use rule-based responses only
```

### Option 3: Switch to Another Service
You can easily switch to OpenAI or Anthropic if you have credits there.
