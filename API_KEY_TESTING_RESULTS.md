# API Key Testing Results

## 🔑 API Key Tested
- **Key**: `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`
- **Format**: `sk-or-v1-` (unusual format)

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ❌ Services Tested (All Failed)

1. **Anthropic Claude** - Authentication error (401)
2. **OpenAI** - Invalid API key (401)
3. **Together AI** - Invalid API key (401)
4. **Perplexity AI** - Authorization required (401)

## 🔍 Analysis

The API key format `sk-or-v1-` is unusual and doesn't match common patterns:
- **OpenAI**: `sk-...` (starts with sk-)
- **Anthropic**: `sk-ant-...` (starts with sk-ant-)
- **DeepSeek**: `sk-...` (starts with sk-)
- **Together AI**: `sk-...` (starts with sk-)

## 💡 Possible Explanations

1. **Different Service Provider** - This might be from a lesser-known AI service
2. **Expired/Invalid Key** - The key might have expired or been revoked
3. **Wrong Format** - The key might need to be used differently
4. **Custom Service** - Could be from a private or custom AI service

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Get a Working API Key
1. **OpenAI** - Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Anthropic** - Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
3. **DeepSeek** - Visit [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)

### Option 2: Use Mock Service Temporarily
Your chatbot is fully functional with rule-based responses:

```typescript
// In services/aiService.ts, change:
service: 'mock' // This will use rule-based responses only
```

### Option 3: Check with Key Provider
If you got this key from a specific service:
1. Check their documentation for correct usage
2. Verify the key hasn't expired
3. Confirm the API endpoint and format
